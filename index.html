The variety of foods, spices and dishes that are native to the two countries, make it one of the most wholesome foods in the world. Traditional Indian food, however, is not only healthy, but is also incredibly tasty with a lot of health benefits. India’s unique blend of cuisines evolved through large-scale cultural interactions with neighbouring Persia, ancient Greece, the Mongols and West Asia. New World foods such as chili peppers, tomatoes, potatoes and squash, introduced by Arab and Portuguese traders during the sixteenth century, and European cooking styles introduced during the colonial period added to the diversity of Indian cuisine. Food is ingrained in the Indian culture to the extent that it contributes to their identity and personality. For many Indians, "sitting down" with their family for a meal is one of the most important activities of the day. An Indian meal, in fact, is always meant to be shared. Everyone eats a bit of everything. There is a strong belief that the family that eats together stays together, and meal time is a strong source of family bonding, talking and sharing.<br><br>Sri Lankan food is not for the timid eater: the fiery curries, sweet caramelised flavoured relishes, powerful flavours that startle and awaken senses. The cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural and other factors. As a tropical island with an abundance of vegetation, Sri Lanka is known for its use of a vast array of herbs, spices, fish, vegetables, rices and fruits. A typical traditional Sri Lankan plate is pescatarian based with a predominant plant-based approach. These coupled with good fats derived from coconuts and 100 per cent grass-fed cow/buffalo ghee are key to reducing inflammatory processes in the body and arriving at the ideal body fat percentage. What takes the cuisine to the next level is the conscious incorporation of their superlative spices. The traditional Ceylonese kitchen was usually the centre of a family’s universe. In it, there were love matches, fights, weddings, special full moon rituals and the travelling chefs who would arrive in bullock carts with their massive pots and cook for hundreds of guests and visitors.<br><br>At KaSa, we aim to cater to your palate by showcasing our range of flavours, and satisfying your inner cravings.
